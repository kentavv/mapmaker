With the advent of RFLPs, genetic linkage maps are now being assembled for a
number of organisms including both inbred experimental populations such as maize 
and outbred natural populations such as humans. Accurate construction of such
genetic maps requires multipoint linkage analysis of particular types of
pedigrees. We describe here a computer package, called MAPMAKER, designed
specifically for this purpose. The program uses an efficient algorithm that
allows simultaneous multipoint analysis of any number of loci. MAPMAKER also
includes an interactive command language that makes it easy for a geneticist to
explore linkage data. MAPMAKER has been applied to the construction of linkage
maps in a number of organisms, including the human and several plants, and we
outline the mapping strategies that have been used.
