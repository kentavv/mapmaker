This file, readme.doc, describes problems and new features in the
current release of Ghostscript.  This file describes version 2.5.2 of
Ghostscript.

For an overview of Ghostscript and a list of the documentation files, see
README.

New features
============

Note: this is not a complete list of new features.  See the most recent
section of NEWS for full details.

The DeskJet and LaserJet drivers (finally) work correctly.

You can now set all settable device properties (OutputFile,
BufferSpace, MaxBitmap) using -s or -d on the command line.

Known problems
==============

Interpreter
-----------

The interactive interpreter requires that every statement fit on a line,
i.e., you can't have an unpaired ( or {.

On a MS-DOS system, interrupting Ghostscript by typing ^C doesn't restore
the display mode.

Operators
---------

The Ghostscript language does not include the following operators of the
PostScript language:

	resetfile
	banddevice, renderbands (these are obsolete)

The following are not implemented completely:

	%statementedit (file name): interpreted as equivalent to
%lineedit.

Most of the new color operators, particularly those that support the CMYK
color model, are implemented as Ghostscript language procedures, and they
essentially emulate CMYK using RGB.

The following operators that expect arrays won't accept packed arrays:
	definefont (Subrs (type 1 fonts))
	setdash (dash pattern)
	setcachedevice (bounding box)
	makeimagedevice (palette)

The file operator only recognizes modes r and w, not the newer modes r+,
w+, a, and a+.

Limitations
-----------

Floating point exceptions terminate Ghostscript, rather than producing a
rangecheck error.

Some access checks aren't implemented.

copypage does nothing in the MS-DOS implementation, and merely
synchronizes the X connection in the Unix implementation.  showpage is a
procedure that does a copypage and then beeps the bell and waits for the
user to hit a key. (copypage does do the right thing for printers.)

Graphics bugs
-------------

strokepath produces incorrect output for dashed lines.

The implementation only looks at the PaintType of the font when doing
show, not when doing charpath.  Because of this, stroked fonts don't work
correctly with charpath.

arcto gives an error for negative radii.

Changing the contents of the Encoding array or the Metrics dictionary of a
font dynamically doesn't produce the expected result (may have no effect)
if character caching is enabled.

Halftone patterns "flip over" at the 50% coverage point, producing
anomalous visual effects on some color devices.

We have not been able to test 2-, 4-, and 16-bit memory devices as
thoroughly as 1-, 8-, 24-, and 32-bit devices; please report any
problems.

Opening more than one window device at the same time doesn't work.
This is the case for both X Windows and Microsoft Windows.

Non-graphics bugs
-----------------

restore doesn't properly undo currentgstate.

copy doesn't handle gstates.
