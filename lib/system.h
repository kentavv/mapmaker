/***************************************************************************
This file, along with the syscode.c file, is used to provide most, if
not all system specific, definitions allowing our library files to
port from one system to another.  Note that these declarations are
provided for the shell library code, NOT NECESSARILY FOR THE APPLICATION
CODE! See the apropriate ...lib.h file for a list of the functions you
should use.

With the increasing encroachment of ANSI C, we can now get away with
only only one system.h files (with #ifdefs, of course) for all
systems. An ANSI compiler doesn't help too much, because Sun/DEC (and
others) include files are just not ANSI. At present, fixes are in
place for:

* SunOS 4.1.x with the bundled cc (ANSI-C, just say no)
* DEC Ultrix 4.2 on the nice but now obsolete DECStation line (cc, not acc)
* Apple's A/UX 3.0 on high end Macintoshes
* WATCOM C/386 9.0 on MicroSloth's MS-DOG, optionally with M$-Windoze 3.1

Previous versions of this library have been ported in various flavors
to Mac ThinkC and VMS as well as other flavors of Unix - hopefully
these ports will happen again for this version soon. If you port this
code, we suggest you use the following flags:

   _SYS_SUNOS	Specifics for SunOS 4.1.x (only tried SPARC)
   _SYS_SOLARIS	Specifics for Solaris 2.x (SPARC and Intel versions identical?)
   _SYS_AUX	Specifics for Apple's A/UX 3.0
   _SYS_MACHTEN	Specifics for Tennon's MachTen on Macintosh (tried & failed!) 
   _SYS_ULTRIX	Specifics for DEC RISC/ULTRIX 4.x (for MIPS based DECStations)
   _SYS_OSF	Specifics for OSF/1 for DEC Alpha (like, if it ever ships)
   _SYS_AIX	Specifics for the inferior but marketable AIX (RISC or other?)
   _SYS_HPUX	Specifics for HP-UX (8.x?) for HP 9000/700 series.
   _SYS_UNIX	Basic Unix semantics, defined if any one of the above is

   _SYS_WATCOM  Specifics for WATCOM C/386 9.0 with apropriate libraries
   _SYS_DOS	Basic DOS semantics, defined if the above is

   _SYS_THINKC  Specifics for ThinkC (5.0?)
   _SYS_MPW     Specifics for MPW C (ver???)
   _SYS_MAC	Basic MAC semantics, should be defined if one of the above is

   Things I'm not quite sure what to do with...
   _SYS_NT	Windoze/NT (Not There) on Intel (what about Alpha/MIPS/etc?)
   _SYS_OS2	OS/2 2.x (gives me the willies just to think about it)
   _SYS_NEXT	NeXTStep 3.0, wiTh ThE fUNkey CaPItaLizAtION (040 or Intel?)
   _SYS_VMS	Basic VMS semantics (what options are there?)

Of course most of these flags are not handled yet. Happy porting :-)

Among other things ,this is the only file which understands which of
the system's #include files need to be used, as well as what order
they should be included in! (This is handled at the end of this file).
You should include standard files by #defining one or more of the
following and then #including "system.h":

   INC_IO      File and TTY I/O routines, including stdio.
   INC_MATH    Simple math routines. 
   INC_MSG     Message sending and trapping routines. 
   INC_MEM     Memory allocation/free routines. 
   INC_STR     String functions, including C's and this library's.
   INC_LIB     All five of the above.

   INC_MISC    Misc. functions (time, subshells, array dumps, sorting, etc).  
   INC_SHELL   The ubiquitous MAPMAKERish shell.
   INC_TABLE   A useful data struct, used by the shell and other things.

/**************************** Subshells *********************************
To help portability, we use the system() function to spawn subshells
on all operating systems. (However, system specific code may be placed
in syscode.c to do it another way). Under Unix, if TRY_SHELL_VAR is
TRUE, getenv() will be used to get the value of SHELL to run by
calling system(getenv("SHELL")). If the SHELL variable is not set we
try calling system(TRY_SHELL_CMD). Naturally, these presume
HAVE_GETENV is defined.

On MS-DOS we will first try system(getenv("COMSPEC")). Otherwise,
TRY_SHELL_CMD should be "command.com". System() is not supported on the
Mac, and on VMS, SHELL_CMD should be "SPAWN".

/************************ Error handling routines ************************* 
Errno lookups: strerror(), which is allegedly ANSI standard, should
return an error message (char*) when given a correct system errno
(generally from ferror()). Don't use perror(). For systems without
strerror(), use sys_errlist[] and sys_nerr (this includes Lightspeed,
System V, HP-UX, and SunOS). If sys_nerr does not exist, we ignore it
and hope that sysnerr[errno] is valid... On some systems (Sun)
sys_errlist does not appear in any #include file, although errno
(extern int) is defined (usu. in math.h?).

Also, define HAVE_MATHERR if matherr() trapping is supported, as it
is on System V (See msglib.h). SIGHANDLE should be the return value
type of a signal handling function used as an argument to signal().

/************************* Random Numbers **********************************
There are at least 3 standard random number generators in C-libraries:
rand() (ANSI, fairly ubiquitous), drand48() (System V), and random() (BSD).
Rand() is a lousy random number generator: don't use it unless no
other is available. See the code for these in syscode.c.  The limits sont
seem to be real portable, so be careful.

/***************************** C-Library **************************************
Here are some casts to make various incompatible C-library functions
compatible accross machines. NONE OF THESE FUNCTIONS SHOULD BE CALLED
DIRECTLY! RATHER, THEY SHOULD BE CALLED ONLY BY THE HELPERS ROUTINES
WHICH DRIVE THEM!  Define the constants appropriately so that the
following declarations are correct on the target machine:

      CALLOC_PTR_TO *calloc(num,sizeof(...)) 
          CALLOC_NUM_TYPE num;
	  SIZEOF_TYPE size;

      TIME_TYPE time(); 
      char *ctime(ptr) 
          TIME_TYPE *ptr;

      qsort(data,array_length,width,compare)  \*** portability hell ***\
          QSORT_DATA_PTR_TO *data; \* an array \* 
          QSORT_LENGTH array_length;
	  SIZEOF_TYPE width;
          int (*compare)();
      int compare(a,b)
          QSORT_COMPARE_PTR_TO(type) *a, *b;

where type is the type of thing that pointers into data (eg a and b) really 
point to. For example, to compare long integers, the code should read (Note: 
better interfaces are provided in the library - see misclib.h for them!) 

      int long_compare(a,b)
      QSORT_COMPARE_PTR_TO(long) *a;
      QSORT_COMPARE_PTR_TO(long) *b;
      { 
          long x,y; 
	  x= *(long*)a; y= *(long*)b; 
	  if (x<y) return(-1); else if (x==y) return(0); else return(1); 
      }
      ...
      qsort(QSORT_CAST(data),(QSORT_LENGTH)length,sizeof(long),long_compare)

Qsort()'s return value, if it has one, is ignored. We assume that qsort never
fails (perhaps this is stupid).

Define (and use!) exit_main as the statement which main() should execute 
when the program normally terminates. abnormal_exit should be an exit()
call for abnormal situations (mostly for the HP 800 exit() bus-error bug!)

Define HAVE_CHDIR, HAVE_GETCWD, and/or HAVE_GETENV if those functions exist.
Check out their usage (arguments, etc) in syscode.c to be safe!

/**************************** Terminal I/O ********************************
If TRY_GETENV_TERM is set, the system first tries to recognize the
string returned by getenv("TERM"). The system can deal with the
following terminal types, in terms of very, very basic screen I/O:

						Default  Escape	 Assume
 TERM variable	 Terminal			#Lines	 Codes   Scrollback?
 ------------	 -------			------	 -----	 -----------
 ansi*		 simple DEC VT-100 compatible	24	 ANSI	 Yes (new)
 dec*, vt*		   "			"        "       "
 xterm*	 	 X-Windows vt-100 emulator	"	 "	 "
 mac*	 	 A/UX CommandShell window	"	 "	 "
 sun*		 Sun workstation console or	36	 ANSI	 Yes (new)
 		 SunView shelltool/cmdtool
 pc*		 PC with ANSI.SYS loaded	25	 ANSI	 No
 hp*		 most Hewlett-Packards		24	 HP	 Yes
 300* 		 HP 9000 console		46	 HP	 Yes
 anything else	 unknown terminal type		24	 none	 No

[Note: here * means any characters can follow, including possibly none.]

If the TERM shell variable is set, then on Unix we may try to lookup
the screen length using the termcap functions, if HAVE_TERMCAP is
defined.  On any system we then try to use the LINES environment
variable (LINES over-rides termcap). We do not try to look up anything
else using termcap (too ugly, bleach). If HAVE_WINSIZE is defined, the
termios (POSIX) ioctl(fileno(stdout),TIOCGWINSZ,struct winsize*) is
used to get the #lines, and it WILL be used appropriately to see if
the window's size changed (we do not have a SIGWINCH handler however).
This value will supercede the defaults above. As yet no attempt is
made to determine the screen width (see note below).

There was a TRY_TERMINFO flag, to use terminfo instead of termcap, but
it may be broken. All Unixes seem to have termcap these days. Someone
wanna fix it?

IMPORTANT NOTE FOR WINDOWING SYSTEMS: If HAVE_WINSIZE does not work,
then it will be impossible for the shell to tell if the #lines changes
after it has started (e.g. if a terminal emulator window is resized).

In ALL cases, we really want to use an 80-character wide window or
screen! We assume 79 chars max per output line with tabs every 8
spaces, to maximize portability. (Really avoid system dependent
terminal widths, or otherwise transcript files must be printed on a
wider printer, other system's editors and so forth must be able to
deal, E-mailing files can be a problem, and... ick!). It's probably a
good idea to always keep TRANSLATE_TABS set.

If DEFAULT_SCROLLBACK is defined (to either TRUE or FALSE) the default
assumptions about scrollback are ignored. If scrollback is assumed, then
the screen is not cleared. More-mode is now always diabled at first.

/************************** Stdio interface *******************************
The TTY/Text File I/O library now assumes that the following functions
exist and work as in ANSI (or Unix System V, if not in K&R). Note that
we use a very small subset of the USUAL stdio/Unix-I/O library, for
portability's sake. If a function is not listed here, then we probably
found a portability problem somewhere, so don't use it! (Actually, as
always, the application code should only use the functions described
in iolib.h).

K&R did not specify what the output routine putc() does on errors,
nor does it specify its return value type. The same is true of fclose().
In practice, on different systems they do different things. Define 
xputc() and xclose() here to return TRUE if OK or FALSE if error.

We assume that fgets() provides standard I/O preprocessing (delete key 
and so forth). For details of the curses interface, see cursesio.c.

   printf(...)	  	     not used in general, but only in special cases
   fprintf(...)	  	     ditto
   scanf(...)	  	     ditto
   fscanf(...)	  	     ditto
   sprintf(...)		     used everywhere (aliased to "sf" in strlib.h) 
   int sscanf(...)    	     returns # tokens parsed
   fflush(FILE *fp)	     can't fail if fp is OK

   int feof(FILE *fp)	     returns T/F AFTER a call to xgetc() gives EOF
   int ferror(FILE *fp)      returns errno>=0 or 0 indicating "no error"
   int getc(FILE *fp)        returns c or EOF 
   ungetc(int c; FILE *fp)   it can't fail

   FILE *fopen(char *nam,*mode)         NULL if fail
   fseek(FILE *fp; long num; int dir)   it can't fail if fp is OK
   int fgets(FILE *fp; char *s; int n)  may return EOF char

Note that functions listed without return types here may or may not be of 
type void: on many systems they are of type int! However, the fuction's
return value is always (and should always be) discarded, if it exists.

We provide a workaround for fseek(), which seems to have bugs on VMS.
***************************************************************************/
#define xputc(c,fp) (putc(c,fp)!= EOF)
#define xclose(fp)  (fclose(fp)!= EOF)
#define file_seek(fp,char_num) fseek(fp,((long)(char_num)),0)
/* #define REPLACE_FSEEK *//* Needed on VMS? */


/**************** GLOBAL DECLARATIONS FOR USERS OF LIB *****************
Good working assumptions about data types, etc:

  * Doubles are big (say e+/-30, at least): avoid single precision (float)
    or other floating point types like the plauge.
  * A short is 2 bytes and a long is 4 bytes, both are signed.
  * An int is either a short or a long. On everything we use now, its long.
  * A char can take 7 (NOT 8) bits (0-127), positive values only.
  * unsigned ints exist, but there are a number of reasons not to use them 
    (it is easy for arguments to get passed incorrectly).
  * Never-ever assume that shifts wrap around correctly (or don't wrap 
    correctly), or that overflow/underflow ever produces predictable results
  * God knows what a pointer is. Always cast pointer types correctly,
    and avoid recasting pointers in general. 
  * Always make sure that arguments passed=arguments declared EXACTLY! Many
    bugs arrise if you don't. Never assume that parameters in a function call 
    will be automaticly be cast correctly. Be explicit.
  * Pass structs/unions/arrays as args by pointer ONLY. Passing by value is not
    even close to portable. Variable length argument lists are not portable.
    Returning structs/unions/arrays by value is also unportable.
  * Never-ever-ever try to side-effect constants. The biggest culprit here
    is passing a string argument to a function which then try to change 
    characters in the string. This causes bus errors on most systems.
  * void exists, but void* doesn't, nor does enum. Use void, not int, for
    procedures that return nothing
  * Really avoid other implicit int declarations (ex arguments w/o a type 
    are assumed to be ints - YUK!)
  * Only assume that the result of a boolean expression (ex x<y) is zero
    (FALSE) or nonzero (TRUE). Thus, expressions like "if (flag==TRUE) ..."
    are a very bad idea. Instead say "if (flag) ...".
  * Otherwise, what the original K&R version 1 says goes.

Note that the following definitions are specs and should never be
changed! They exist only to clarify code, not to allow any sort of
data-type abstraction!
