/************* IOLIB.H - terminal and text file I/O functions *************
OVERVIEW:

Terminal I/O is in general assumed to be "glass-TTY" type line
oriented blocking I/O with most relevent pre-processing handled by the
operating system or this library. (In other words, line editing
[delete keys and and so forth], buffering, echoing characters, and
type-ahead are handled.) Input will not be recieved until an entire
line has been read, and calls to input functions will hang until a
line is ready. Assume that 78 columns of output are possible, that output
lines scroll off the screen, and that at least 24 lines can fit on a
screen. Print()ed strings may be buffered until a '\n', flush(), or
input()/getln() call. These functions should be reasonably well-behaved 
if the program's input or output has been redirected, piped, etc. 

The text file I/O routines operate very similarly. Random access or
binary files are not in general a good idea as both the code for such
files and the files themselves are largely unportable. It is also not
recomended that anything but a disk file be opened using the functions
here (eg do not do open_file("/dev/tty",READ)).

Fancy output modes, including "photo-ing", MORE-processing, scrollback
and input/output redirection are provided by this library. These are
implemented in such a way that most application code can almost
completely ignore them: if the library I/O routines are used
exclusively (eg print()), something reasonable will happen whan thay
are called. The few routines which are exceptions return a boolean on
success or failure which can be tested. 

Even fancier stuff, like better line editing, split screen, and
asychronous scrollback has been or will be hacked into this library,
using curses, X-windows, or the Macintosh toolbox. This now works
under Unix, and VMS, and should work on PCs and Macs soon.

The print string ps may be used to hold one screen line for output
using sprintf() and print() [or pr()]. Always print ps IMMEDIATELY
after it is set, otherwise it may get side-effected in your own
procedure calls!  Ps is large (2K chars) for paranoia's sake, as
sprintf() can spew out some very large strings of characterss in error
conditions. Assume its really only one (or maybe 2-3) lines. ps_ is similar, 
but for internal use only by the functions in this library.

Ln is a global input string side-effected by getln() and fgetln().
The pointer ln itself may be side-effected, (eg: by the token parsing
routines) as it is reset during each call to getln() or fgetln().
However, the string space used to hold the input line is reused, and
any pointers into the ln string which you saved may point to trash
after one of these calls. Ln is alloced for 2K chars, leaving lots of
room for paranoia (again, assume it's much smaller).

Note that the print() and fprint() functions do an awful lot of
processing on the output string, including trying to wrap lines at
word breaks, converting tabs to spaces (every 8 chars), buffering
output (perhaps multiple lines!) and more. The do_fwrite() function does
not do this. Similarly, the getln() function despace()es,
lowercase()es, and filter()s its input, while fgetln(), input(), and
finput() functions do not [yes, it's a somewhat odd inconsistancy, but
it's handy].

It is recomended that only the I/O functions mentioned in here be
used, and that most other I/O functions never be used directly. This
is both because these functions have been tailored for portability and
robustness (crash-proofing), and because they provide a powerful
line-oriented interface which takes as much advantage of the operating
system as it can. Certainly never intermix code that uses these with
code that uses Unix-ish I/O directly!

Iocheck() someday may be a function which should be called
occasionally to check for the break key, pending output for MORE, etc
on computers which don't support asynchronous terminal I/O. This is
best done inside some loop in any computationally ugly piece of code
such that it gets called at least once every few seconds. Iocheck()
returns TRUE if an entire line of input is waiting to be read with
input() or getln(). Do not place iocheck() calls inside
computationally critical loops, as iocheck() may take some time itself
(though likely doesn't).  NOTE: iocheck() IS NOT YET IMPLEMENTED - it
exists but does nothing, and it may never...
